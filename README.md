Use My Tech Stuff: like AirBnB, but for high end electronics. Are you tired of paying ridiculous fees for camera and other equipment rentals? Bypass the middleman and rent from a real person!

UseMyTechStuff is one of the world’s largest marketplaces for unique, authentic tech to borrow for various activities, all powered by local hosts. An economic empowerment engine, UseMyTechStuff has helped millions of tech entrepreneurs monetise their equipment and their passions while keeping the financial benefits of technology in their own communities. With more than three quarters of a billion guest rentals to date, and accessible in 62 languages across 220+ countries and regions, UseMyTechStuff promotes people-to-people connection, community and trust around the world.
